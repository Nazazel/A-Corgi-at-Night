(for ninja star throwing cat) 
Woah, this cat ain't like the others! He throws...shurikens?! 
Better dodge those ninja stars or else it's over. 
Remember, when near, you can press "E" to bark at these mean ol' cats to poof them away.

(for enthusiastic carnival kid)
Oh boy, this kid sure likes Quinn and his grip sure is strong for a child! 
To free Quinn of the kid's grasp, repeatedly tap the left and right arrow keys!

(for pigeon)
That pigeon just threw an egg that exploded. Try to avoid getting hit if you don't wanna get scrambled.

(for lasers)
Hm, I don't think lasers like cute, fluffy dogs..or is it the other way around? 
Avoid lasers to prevent Quinn from getting hurt!

(for asteriods)
Dodge asteriods to avoid getting injured!

(for dog catcher jr. scientist)
You can't help but feel you've seen this guy somewhere before. 
Hm, must be a coincidence...though his head does seem nice to stomp on.

(for roombas)
Is that a...knife wielding roomba? Well, I think you've seen it all. 
Don't approach these nasty roomba's head on, try using them as platforms instead!
