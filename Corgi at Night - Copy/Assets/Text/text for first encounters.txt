(for enthusiastic carnival kid)
Oh boy, this little dude sure likes Quinn and his grip sure is strong for a kid!
To free Quinn of the kid's grasp, repeatedly tap the left and right arrow keys!

(for pigeon)
That pigeon just threw an egg that exploded. Try to avoid getting hit if you don't wanna get scrambled.

(for lasers)
Hm, I don't think lasers like cute, fluffy dogs..or is it the other way around? 
Avoid lasers to prevent Quinn from getting hurt!

(for asteroids)
Dodge asteroids to avoid getting injured!

(for regular roombas)
Is that a...knife wielding roomba? Well, I think you've seen it all. 
Don't approach these nasty roomba's head on, try using them as platforms instead!

(for C4 doombas)
Oh my, is that C4? Hm, maybe it's best to avoid things that go kablooey!

(for chainsaw doomba)
Oh so it's chainsaws now? Geez, what's next, deadly fedoras? You know the drill, jump over the chainsaw wielding roomba to avoid getting hurt!

(for flying doomba)
Ok that's a flying roomba...with knives attached to its sides and a red hot flame coming out from its bottom. Hey it's dangerous but Quinn likes to live on the edge.
Use these robo dudes as platforms to avoid getting zapped by the electric panels below!

(For Wall-e)
That doesn't look like a very friendly rover. Show him who's boss by stomping on him not once, but TWICE!

(UFO)
These aliens are out to get cute, stubby corgis! Watch out for their beams if you don't wanna get abducted!
